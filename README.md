# Reinforcement learning 
  
A repository for notes and code as I learn about various reinforcement learning methods.    

1. Multi-armed bandits:

	- `bandit_notes.tex, .pdf`: Notes about multi-armed bandits. 
	- `multi_armed_bandit.py`: A multi-armed bandit class that I wrote for practice. 
	- `bandit.ipynb`: A notebook that explores the results of running the multi-armed bandit with different parameters.
